## PopGen Workshop - Global ancestry inference using ADMIXTURE ##
## Demonstration ##

In this demonstration, we will show you how to use the ADMIXTURE ancestry inference software to obtain global ancestry proportions for your target samples.

# Step 1: 
ADMIXTURE requires unlinked SNPs in PLINK binary file format. Perform LD-pruning in PLINK on your merged file (i.e. the one following post-imputation QC) using the following parameters - r2 > 0.1 within a 50 SNP sliding window, advanced by 10 SNPs at a time.

./plink2 --bfile PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC.bed --indep-pairwise 50 10 0.1 --out LD-pruned

# Step 2: 
Extract the unlinked SNPs from the merged file. 

./plink2 --bfile PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC.bed --extract LD-pruned.prune.in --make-bed --out PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC_LD-pruned

# Step 3: 
We are now ready to run ADMIXTURE. Run it with cross-validation for K-values between K=2 and K=6 to determine the correct number of ancestries contributing to your target population. Note that, for ADMIXTURE, your target and reference samples must be in one file. 

for K in {2..6}; do ./admixture --cv PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC_LD-pruned.bed ${K} > log.K${K}.out; done

The correct number of ancestral contributions (i.e. the correct K value) is typically the value with the lowest cross-valiation error. We can quickly view the CV errors: 

grep -h CV log.*.out 
# Output for our dataset #
CV error (K=2): 0.29982
CV error (K=3): 0.31134
CV error (K=4): 0.32237
CV error (K=5): 0.34165
CV error (K=6): 0.36845

However, it might also be useful to view the global ancestral proportions for all individuals for all values of K to determine which K-value makes the most sense.

# Step 4:
Visualise the global ancestry proportions determined by ADMIXTURE in an admixture plot using pong.
More detail on the files required to run pong can be found on the software's GitHub page (https://github.com/ramachandran-lab/pong). We have included the files required for this run in the ADMIXTURE directory. 

./pong -m pong_filemap.txt -i ind2pop.txt -n pop_order.txt

Navigate to the webserver provided to visualise the plot.
