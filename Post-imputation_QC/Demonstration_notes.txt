## PopGen Workshop - Post-imputation QC ##
## Demonstration ##

# It is likely that there will be some genotypes that were not imputed with a high degree of accuracy or certainty. We would like to exclude these genotypes so that they do not cause spurious results downstream. In this demonstration, we will show you how to remove SNPs with imputation INFO quality scores below 0.8. Remember, the INFO score is a value between 0 and 1 that tells us how well a genotype has been imputed. INFO score values close to 1 indicate that a SNP has been imputed with a high degree of certainty that the genotype is correct. 

# Step 1: Remove SNPs with INFO scores less than 0.8.
You should have already downloaded your imputed files (chromosomes 1 to 22) from the Sanger Imputation Server. To improve computational efficiency, we will work with the files in per-chromosome format and use some basic Unix for-loops to run our commands. 

for i in {1..22}; do bcftools filter -e 'INFO/INFO<0.8' ${i}.pbwt_reference_impute.vcf.gz -Oz -o chr${i}_imputed_INFO.vcf.gz; done

# Step 2: Remove SNPs with MAF less than 0.01. 
This step will remove really rare SNPs (which are not the focus of this workshop) and improve the computational efficiency of our downstream analyses. Again, we will use a basic for-loop to apply the filter to all chromosomes. 

for i in {1..22}; do bcftools filter -e 'INFO/RefPanelAF<0.01' chr${i}_imputed_INFO.vcf.gz -Oz -o chr${i}_imputed_INFO_MAF.vcf.gz; done

# Step 3: Phase the imputed genotypes. 
Before we move onto ancestry inference, we need to identify whether each allele at each SNP comes from the maternal or paternal chromosome. To do this, we need to perform phasing, the process of inferring haplotypes from genotype data. A phased VCF file will have genotypes separated by a pipe ("|") instead of a forward slash ("/"). 

In this demonstration, we will phase our imputed VCF files using SHAPEIT. You will also need a haplotype map (in this demonstration, we will use the HapMap recombination map file available at https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/hapmap/recombination/2011-01_phaseII_B37/).

for i in {1..22}; do ./shapeit --input-vcf chr${i}_imputed_INFO_MAF.vcf.gz -M genetic_map_chr${i}_combined_b37.txt -O chr${i}_imputed_INFO_MAF.phased; done

## Note, phasing is a computationally intensive process. It will take a while to run and will require a bit of free memory. ##

Once your files are phased, you can convert to VCF format.

for i in {1..22}; do ./../SHAPEIT -convert --input-haps chr${i}_imputed_QC_phased.phased.haps --output-vcf chr${i}_imputed_QC_phased.vcf; done

Finally, you can join all the chromosomes together to form one file using BCFTools. 
# BGZip all files
for i in {1..22}; do bgzip chr${i}_imputed_QC_phased.vcf; done
# Tabix the BGZipped files
for i in {1..22}; do tabix -p vcf chr${i}_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz; done
# Join all the chromosomes together
bcftools concat chr1_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr2_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr3_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr4_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr5_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr6_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr7_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr8_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr9_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr10_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr11_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr12_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr13_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr14_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr15_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr16_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr17_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr18_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr19_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr20_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr21_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz chr22_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz -Oz -o PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz

# Step 4: Remove related individuals. 
Many downstream statistical analyses, such as ancestry inference and genetic association models, require all individuals in the dataset to be unrelated. Before we move on, we must look to see if there are related individuals in our dataset and remove one related individual from each relationship pair. Normally, we want to remove individuals that are closer than second-degree relatives. 

## Note, LD pruning is not recommended for running KING.

First, convert your merged, imputed, QC'd and phased file to PLINK binary file format. 

./plink2 --vcf PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC_phased.vcf.gz --make-bed --out PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC

Now, run king to identify 2nd degree relatives to be removed.

./king -b PopGen_allSamples_imputed_QC.bed --unrelated --degree 2

The list of unrelated individuals can now be extracted from your dataset using PLINK. Look in the PLINK documentation for how to do this and try it now on your own ;)

You are now ready to move onto the next step - Ancestry inference!
